Project Zanl is my personal project for my “dreams” or fictional ideas. This has been going for a while, and I find it cool to build my own world or work on something I like. Writing is my dream. Zanl itself, is more of a name for the container/project that holds all my ideas.

As of December 12, 2023, I forgot to mention this: The start date of Zanl is based on the very first creation I’ve ever made, the Aperen (Specifically, its Blood Rush form). 

The Aperen is a soon-to-be mentioned sword in Blood Birth. However, both that and the C9B Roblox Game were the two things that actually jump started the project.

For another description of the project, This project includes many fictional characters, vehicles, and other concepts I've made. Most of all these works are inspired from things in the real world or from my dreams. All of it took an extremely long time to create and think out. The first concept I made was the C9B base, in the form of a Roblox game. Then it was the Aperen and eventually the Norb. I’ve had a lot of fun writing out and visualizing what I dreamt of. I learned many things to help write my ideas beautifully and give them form. Things like learning a 3D modeling program like Blender. My first creation with it was the Norb. Learning graphic design in a way with Paint.net. Stable Diffusion with AI to give some of my characters a temporary finished form. Don’t worry, I'll learn to draw the characters one day, so I can replace the AI generated ones. 

I still have not finished the project, but I will keep working on it despite the highs and lows of life. It will keep going on forever until I Starleap. When I finish the characters and everything else, I will heavily work on the World Build. The World Build will give my characters life with multiple stories and interactions.  This will take tens of years to finally finish, but it will be extremely worth it. And at the closing point of life, I shall write at the bottom of the page, “The End.” That is, if I live out my entire life, so I pray to god that nothing happens to me and others. But overall, I had fun writing and being creative. 

# Origin
Comes from the letters I saw in the old logo (the square one). I saw a “Z” first then a “A”, “N” and lastly a  “L”. Then I said to myself, “Zanl? Woah, cool name.” I compared it to sounding of the word, “Vinyl”, and I was “Cool”. That’s the story of how it got its name. Also when I figured out its name I made a time stamp in this document.
