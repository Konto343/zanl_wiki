Aeta is a immortal cosmic entity that watches over a majority of the universe with his brother, Necrodon. It is genderless, but is referred to a male due to it's body type and voice.

He represents the naturally good half of what was Despair. Aeta is a very deep thinker, possessing deep intellect on the behavior of living organisms. 

Aeta is completely white in appearance with a humanoid shape. They're slight shadows that cover his body, giving it darkened edges that allow parts of his body to be seen properly. A nearly-flat crown will hover above Aeta's head at all times. Originally, this crown didn't exist when Aeta woke up from his creation, but it's symbolic of a friend he first met.

Unlike Necrodon, Aeta has strong ties to Hope's location and well being at times when problems arise.

## Name origin: 
Came from a dream, or my brain in this case. Yes I’m serious that my brain just made that name whenever I woke up. It must’ve worked on it while I was sleeping?
