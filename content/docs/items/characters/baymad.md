Baymad, or Kendra Rae Baymad is woman that comes from the planet, Dama. 

Baymad was the highest ranking commander of her legion, Genesis. Now, her daughter, Mila Baymad, assumed the leadership of the legion, advancing into space after 25 years of space trade with various alien groups.

Jectium is a material forged with two unique stones from Dama and outside planets. It is currently used to propel spacecraft into space, advance knowledge of the universe, and be bought by alien races for large sums. 

Dama was a originally an efficient society, with massive trade, low tax rates, and large collaboration among nations. However, the division of nations led to natural uprising of a particular nation, Gohel.

Gohel before it's uprising, was mostly a tools and weapons producer, speeding up hunting, deforestation, and mining. Gohel's military leader, or Kendra's father, Andrew North, wanted more of everything, profits, materials, and a larger army. He had found the equality of the nations, led to them all being equally weak, so if one nation rose above, it be easy to conquer them all. So he eventually took on a plan, destroying most of the neighboring nations, robbing them of their materials, and converting citizens into slave workers.

Kendra was far north when these events happened, however, her mother laid in the same nation that her husband was in. She came to oppose Andrew's decisions and joined riots and protests. Andrew grew curious of what his wife was doing, and spectated a riot one day. They found each other and matched eyes through the chaos, and all she knew was that hadn't been the same man she married. She had left the riots and snuck outside the nation's border, spreading word the her nations's conditions and Andrew's delusions.
