Bex, or Kairo Rudhir, is a man whose undergone the torments of reality all at once. He has succumbed to long and mental torture for one thing, becoming the next Death.

Bex, his true "name", currently stands as the 52nd and last Death. He operates independently of all of those he once knew, preserving peace on a local planet far far away.

Kairo originally, was working at large tech company. He had initially struggled to fit into the large schedule and get to actually meet his coworkers more formally. Later on, he did manage his time more efficiently and met with people after work for activities. His pace was developed, he was a hard worker and a good person. As he built his relationships more and more, he enjoyed life for once.

Then, black figures appeared across the streets, standing still and watching at Kairo from afar. He thought it was something to do with his past stress from work, however, they wouldn't disappear. Noises and other visual anomalies ramped up in quantity around the city. He asked people if they saw what he was seeing, all was the same, "No."

These events drove him insane in the pending months, costing him his job, relationships, and eventually losing the love of his life.  

## Name origin: 
He has multiple sources like my dreams, but my brain never came to give him a name. I grabbed inspiration of two things. The first being Vex, the Gloomist, from League of Legends. And the candy bar, “Twix”. I used every letter in the alphabet letter with “ex” until it sounded right. Then eventually I tried the letter “b” with “ex” and made “Bex”. 

Initially, He actually looked like Necrodon but he had longer spikes on his back and only two eyes.
