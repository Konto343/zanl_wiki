Calyale Zango is the oldest and strongest brother of the Zango family.

Calyale has long black horns with short black hair. He is the tallest among his siblings. 

At a young age, Calyale had trouble working with people his own age, typically preferring talking to older people. Calyale has a very considerate and psychological mindset, often manipulating people to get what he wanted. This grew and he developed his skills with talking to other people like him. 

Calyale's father wanted to him to join the massive legion he led over, Onzal. However, his father's was illogical and delusive despite even seeking the best for his children. However, Calyale didn't want that type of future, opting for a peaceful and lively life. The father didn't turn a kind eye to this, capturing and locking Calyale in a deep underground basement. Calyale underwent torture and was left weakly to reconsider his father's offer. He knew painfully that his other siblings wouldn't ever look for him, or even care about him. Calyale still refused and ought to kill his father, but decided to end up not doing so.

For many nights, he trained himself more physically, sparring with old friends and going deep into the darkest parts of the planet to train. He had been willing to interact with Shadow Realm not to gain power, but to torment himself over and over. With enough blood splattered, clothes torn, and thoughtless direction for himself, he went to Kezel.

For his course to Kezel, he faced many "obstructions", that would be placed "aside". He navigated the hell's slopes and canyons, past the sharpest grass, deadliest air, just to prove one point. At the end of his journey, he faced a large black stone door covered in chains. He planned to open the monsterous door with sheer strength, but a large figure blast through the door. A fox-like and huge dark creature spoke through the debris, sensing Calyale's smell in advance.

"You reek of pain." Kezel said.

Many eyes popped out of its back, staring closely at Calyale's movements. Kezel spoke of why Calyale was there. Calyale explained to the large beast that it's head was worthy enough of telling his father of his opinions clearly. Kezel was honored, but doubted the seemingly small child's power, striking with its demonic and spiky paws. 

Their fight would last hours, but in the end, Kezel would bust through his father's door, and dropped a large furry head onto his desk. He left without saying anything, his father, laughing awhile.
