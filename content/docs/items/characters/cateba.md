Cateba Zango is the eldest sister of the Zango family. 

Cateba has short white hair with medium length horns. She is the 2nd tallest in the family.  

She is a person of very sexual nature, often using men and even women to her advantage.

At a young age, Cateba grew up under the care of her mother majority of her life. She was a very kind and intelligent among her peers at school, being a favorite and model student for others. The young demon had developed a strange view for men later on in life. This was due her mother's stories of how she came to regret marrying her husband. Cateba's father was a delusional man who only sought power through any means necessary. She might've been praised by him and showered in gifts, but through her eyes, she saw the broken heart of a terrible father.

Her growing passive aggressive comments and downplaying conversations with her father led her to being separated. He saw how ungrateful she was to the "efforts" he work endlessly for, and her behavior added up to his decision. She was broken from her mother's watch and kicked out of the household, leaving her with nothing, only herself.

Cateba now alone, had it the hard way, but she saw it coming. She use her recognition as a Zango member to employ herself through various jobs. However, her father saw this and cut her status off. Which, along his acts, framed her for the abuse of his wife. Society would pick this news up through time, and Cateba would lose her job for the last time.

She had no where left to go. Her mind was left a static mess, numb to the voices of passer by's. Perfection was her long time image, but now it was only shards of something past her. Cateba drifted, walking to deep parts of the city, wondering a maze of lights and blurry faces. It was night. The street lights turned off and were replaced by red lights, brimming in bloody glow.

Shops transformed into displays of lust. Women came out to present them selves as men came flowing by. Fumes and smoke covered the entire area and strange substances were consumed. People started to move like lost pigs, bumping into the walls and shouting randomly. Cateba though torn, regained some mentality and looked around more closely. They were "vulnerable", she thought.

She tried to contain her partly hatred for men, but she went up to them and made out with them. Cateba was often looking around repetitively, selecting individuals appearing at their lowest. It was tricky, but she quickly gained experience and did this for another couple nights. In the morning, barely sober, all the men that came into Cateba the night previous had their money missing. 

Quickly, using her new found wealth, changed her appearance, cutting a majority of her hair off. She made a contract with the Shadow Realm to permanently alter her body and face. However, the cost and agony of the contract was something she ignored, as she now use her look to better use. Cateba purchased a dark robe a appealing clothing underneath and wondered into the Red Light district.

That night, and the nights after which, more and more men would go missing. Their corpses found mangled and severely stabbed, however all their belongings were no where to be seen. Cateba moved around the city shaping this "profession" to perfection.
