# Death (Alex Woods)
*Created: (March 31, 2023)*

Alex is was the 51st Death in the Death lineup, contributing to the intergalactic trading economy and pursuing a range of different jobs.  

Alex, or by his Death Name, "Raon" [(Find later in BB:3)], was announced as Death at the age of 32. Picking up from he what he was taught from the previous Death. He's currently the only person to find and weld the Aperen. 

Alex Woods was a poor boy who lived midst of the industrial revolution Earth. However, he lived in alternate version of Earth called Praf. This planet seemed to be in a perpetual progress of steam, dust, and unfair treatment. He was a only child born to world which quickly torn him through his mind, ingraining a permanent weak and hateful image of the world.

He loved his family, but as much he had to work, spending time with them wasn't possible. The grueling tasks managed to keep him active and made their family survive together. This changed as he aged 17, which his mother would succumb to a deadly disease. The money that collected wasn't enough to pay off the treatment, so his mother passed away. For his father, was found dangling from a noose outside the factory's entrance, marking another one lost to the horrible world. 

As Alex found his father in such a state, it depraved him all of emotion, leaving him blank. The weather would further add to the staleness as rain poured across the city. The clouds turned black, with smoke tainting them. He returned home, not being able to recall anything the day previous. However, returning to the grey, dark, and old wooden, he'd only heard the reverbnation of rain drops. 

A voice awoke, fading into his mind, it was afar, but very recognizable. A figure blended into the light from the dark, it wore a dark and dirt outfit. It approached. Alex saw it's face, it was his father. So in response, he hugged the figure unknowningly.

It's voice changed, pivoting to a deeper voice, smooth and grim. The figure grabbed the young Alex back before he came to a quick realization. The boy struggled to break free from it's clingy hands. It spoke, telling his story about its own torment, slowly convincing him to why he allow him to teach him.

Later on, he come under the mysterious figure's ways to become the next Death to succeed it.

## Name origin: 
Just a simple name given to him after the grim-reaper like appearance he has. He is just cloaked with his face barely showing. I say “grim-reaper like” to describe the torn and broken state of his cloak. He is also named after the name I used when anonymously ordering packages from Amazon at the time.
