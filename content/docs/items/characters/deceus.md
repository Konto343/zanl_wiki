A man powered by greed and money. Is able to move sliently around and evade spaces quickly. Slightly insane.

Middle child of the Zango family. Picks on people and loves money. Very greedy, but remains serious and professional.

---------------

Deceus is the youngest and shortest member of the Zango family. Considering himself as the "middle child" despite being the youngest.

Deceus is one of the fastest devils to stand on their planet. He is emotionally powered through the materialistic value of currency, and money.

Deceus is a quiet-type of person, remaining silent during conversations, avoiding conflict, and standing in the background. He possesses the unique ability to move without making a single noise. The fast fiend, can sometimes hear "voices" of "them" whenever in stress, having a short temper along so.

As a child, he was distant from his family, away from his father and mother at times. He'd wander into areas without other people in them, crawling into dark and almost random places. The color of walls, ceiling, and floor seemed bland without any strength to it. In the distance, a sparkly glare nailed to his eyes, he wonder across following it to spot on the floor. A coin. Imprinted with a detail design on it's gold surface, he picked it up. It was as large as his palm, circular perfection.

He loved the design of these coins, and so, began to hoard them. In a hidden area he keep many of the shiny and metallic objects. As time went on, the stash grew larger and larger. The amount of things grew so large, that he'd have to move them all to a new area. As he hoarding in bulk the things he had kept to himself by bag and bag, his parents found him, questioning him. As profitable as they were, they took the things in his stash, keeping it to themselves. They gave him a lesson to "contribute to the household", however he'd never take that.

[Flag: Contextual reasoning for the sibling needed.]

In a fit of rage, he continued his gathering, but outside the house, far-far away. Soon, he found this back and forth, too time consuming, and left the household all together. Leaving behind his family, and sibling.

He venture deep into the crevasses of the underworld. The eyes that pass him, only stared momentaily before continuing on. Deceus wandered into an old factory used to mass produce weapons in the war times. Here, he refitted the place, turning every nook and corner into his own.

He ought to restart, so he grabbed a gold cold he keep deep inside his pocket, and he tossed it onto the floor. It was barely anything, but it forced him to undergo training to hone his skills, speed, and stealth. Eventually, it wasn't enough and so he observed others doing the same, taking mental notes of how to do what they did but butter. Over and over again, he failed, succeeded, and laughed. Never did he once cry, he only took pain and turned into dedication.   

Years pass, as a vast amount of jewels, weapons, and many-many coins laid. Of course, each one was as hard to obtain as the others. Bank theft, backstabbing, ambushing, and other tricks were few used to grew this large collection of wealth.
