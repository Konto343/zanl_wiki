# Despair
*Created: I Forgot*

Despair is a powerful cosmic entity created by Eternity, which is able to cause mass destruction on galactic scale. It's a discard of the "Evil" Eternity kept inside it's body. 

Despair is a tall slim black figure with two pairs of wings. It legs are as slim as it's arms, however, it's legs are pointed at the end. Two white rings are at the bottom of its legs to create uplift, giving Despair the ability to fly at any speed it desires.

It has a elongated diamond-shaped head with the front having a slim cross-section of bright white, acting as it's "eye". Along with its tall stature, it's torso and parts of it's body are displaced, creating sharp edges and deformities.

Despair has the able to morph it's entire body like a free-moving liquid, be as small as atom or as big a mountain. It has no limit to doing so, but it maintains it size to a constant, being around 15 ft tall.

It's arms are that of giant razor blades, being able to cut through anything.

Despair being a cosmic entity, has no need to sustain itself through finite means, being able to run forever until acted upon a force above it own. It's skin is made of material so embedded in the universe. Thus allowing it to be immune to sub-atomic effects, like temperature, pressure, or space distortion.

Despair has only one directive given by its creator, to handle the half of balance, destruction. However, despite it's task has little to do as the universe is nearly perfect system of chaos. This changed as the Augrolith was formed, prompting Despair to move towards it's new target.

Once it arrived, it stared, now realizing what it was chasing, suddenly had stop existing. A large beam of light came breaking from below, which Despair was navigated through to pinpoint something.

It rushed instantly, striking its target the moment it got. However, what it had killed, was itself. So in the last moments of vision, saw a bright light collapse by two rectangular masses. Rohtua was before the shattered remains of destruction itself. He chose to subdivide Despair it two different forces before it could collapse into the original form. Thus creating, Aeta and Necrodon.
