A animal created by Aeta to seek out evil in the omniverse and control the amount that flows around. Female, superior-like, but worry some for people.

Her appearance is odd as she appears subtly glowing blue with subtle sparkling light like little stars. This cat can be anywhere it wants and teleport. Akhris protects those of pure innocence and those in dire situations. her power cannot be measured odd enough. But she uses it for the greater good. She also can influence events and control outcomes. She can bend time and make things happen when they shouldn't be able to. Akhris’s fur is that of what appeared to be the universe. What I mean is that it had a textureless, shadowless, and bright image of the vast space somewhere in the universe. All it was something that could only be described as “beautiful”. When Akhris heals someone or something, she glows brightly and emits white little “fireflies” that roam and disappear.

Akhris is a cat whose fur is blue in color. Her fur can shimmer with little lights. If you pet her, her fur will be puffy and like the ocean. Her eyes can see far throughout the galaxy. 

The odd thing is that Akhris doesn’t exist infinitely. She only exists as one single entity, which violates the TBRU.

## Origin: 
There isn't a proper process to how i named her, but i came up with "Akhrls" first then it transformed into Akhris (recovered data from old documents)
