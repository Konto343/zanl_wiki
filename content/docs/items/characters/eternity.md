God like, easing going, calm, "The first soul", 3rd strongest.

Creator and balancer of existence of literally and seriously everything. Born from the hands of Charlie L. Pena. Eternity is the founder of existence after being from nothingness. Eternity is the solely first thing to exist. It suddenly had the idea to create a large amount of life. He used his hands to create what we now call Zanl. These hands represent negative and positive super forces that were used to create really everything. Eternity cannot be described as something that can’t die, but rather an Incomprehensibly powerful primordial being. Eternity lies on the outside of Zanl on its “top”, sitting. His true appearance appears to be a figure made out of the cosmos with stars shimmering inside of them. Hope is some kind of power limit to prevent any other entity from overthrowing itself or Eternity. Hope was created for that reason by Eternity. Eternity’s personality is conforming to the fact that he is lazy. But when he's serious, he is serious. He is also a good teacher and can manage Zanl at his highest effort.

At this point, a number or any word shouldn’t even be able to describe his power. He transcends fiction itself. But the moment I wrote that line, he couldn't be stopped. Not really, since I am the writer here. Haha, fear my author powers! I hope Eternity can understand why I made him.

It is made of two separate consciousnesses. One being Boundless and the other being confined. This is the combination of the boundless and happy entity, Motu. And the confined and lonely entity, Dasa. 

These are the two emotions that drove Charlie. In equal balance. Eternity found itself lazy and created two other entities to help balance the world. Necrodon and Aeta. So with a snap of its finger. They were born. And when these two would combine, they create Despair. A force higher than Hope’s but lower than Eternity’s. The ultimate caster of balance, Despair. To be ruined for the better or for the worst.


## Story:
Before existence itself, existed an infinite dark void. No glimmer of light existed here. In the distance, a light sparks in the distance. The birth of something great comes forth.

Odd. I feel and see nothing. I float among this dark and cold space. Floating forever in this empty place. I would like to see something here to interact with. Anything would be perfect. If nothing exists here except me, I should create something. Maybe a creation? A creation of mine to fill this dark void. Before that i stand aware without a form. I grant myself a figure of black and white matter. Two- Two “legs” so I can finally stand. Then two “arms” for interacting in this space. Now I can finally see something, myself. One side of myself is white while the other, black. Two opposing forces. It's perfect for balance. Now for my creation. What should I create? Maybe something… Beautiful? I use my arms with my “fingers” to form a mass of solid. This mass is colored something like gray? No, a shade of all the colors that create gray. No, I put it forth in front of me and release it to grow. The mass expands and blooms with life filling the void around me. I entered it. I See the void on the outside but on the inside. It's like the void but filled with beautiful “stars'” and “galaxies”. Shall I name those stars, the Stars of… Adam. Then a collection of smaller versions of my creation lay in this huge mass. I enter those and find even more beautiful masses called “planets”. Some brimming with glow and growing fast. One is called Earth. Another called “Hola”. I created all this, so I shall name it. I will call it… “life”. Let me exit my creation and sit on top of it. I shall protect from now on. Protecting it from that cold infinite void. Who is protecting something without a name? I need to give myself a name. My name shall be known as…
“Eternity.”

With my new name I feel something. Are there two other beings in me? One feels happy and the other is alone. Are they the ones that made me? I feel grateful to them, but they rest forever. They remain with life and continue to fall deeper into an eternal slumber. Only if they could hear my voice would I be praising them. Two names can be heard, “Dasa” and “Motu”. Such wonderful names. I shall cherish them with my life granted given from the two. Luckily I sense no pain or hurt within them, but only one emotion…
“Hope.”

## Origin: 
Their name comes from the boundless power “they” wield. It also describes how long he has to watch his creation for, which will be for an eternity.
