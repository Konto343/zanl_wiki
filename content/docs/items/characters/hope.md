Created by Aeta to watch over the omniverse for overly powerful people. Acts as a filter for pure souls.

Hope. Hope is the manifestation of the emotion of hope and a primordial being. He resides in ring 1 of Zanl. It will always be there and waiting. But waiting for what, you might ask? It's waiting for a power or force that can overtake Hope’s own power. If a force reaches over that of Hope’s own power, that force shall and _will be destroyed_. Hope has the power to overrule anything and everything, no matter its power. Hope exists as long as the emotion and he is powerful. It has a nickname, being the “Author of Creation”. Hope stays in its core or shell. This shell is called “Hope’s Core”. This core acts like Hope’s domain and sleeping area.

Hope is basically the physically existing “power limit”. Where if you go over it, you will die. It is the “Judge”. And with his eyes he can freeze any entity or object without segfaulting and can bestow Judgement. This judgement can determine the further future and existence of matter. It is unworthy, it ceases to exist. But if it is worthy, it continues to exist, but under Hope’s watch.

When Hope catches something worthy of being judged within its sight. The entity shall be completely frozen and cannot move from where they’re being judged. Hope may say one of two things, “Worthy” or “Discarded”. If the enemy is judged with worthiness, it's allowed to live. But if Hope discards the person, the person shall have their existence wiped. All those who knew of the person being wiped, will forget them. Their choices won’t matter if they fall into the hands of Hope. If something happens to resist Hope’s control over them, Hope will up the force used to contain the person. The pain will increasingly get worse the more they struggle. Their bones shall crush, fighting for their lives.

When Hope isn’t sleeping, it is watching everything from its bed. Waiting for something to pop up. Something to try and take over the omniverse. When isn’t sleeping, he is saving his energy for future enemies.c

Hope has a black and white appearance. It is mostly white, with some black strikes across its arms and legs. He can talk to people, but he rarely does, since he seeks to only carry out his task. If you reason him extremely well, there’s a slight chance he’ll let you go.

## Story:
Hope was created from a higher being in the omniverse. This being would watch and control all of Zanl from the shadows. It stands and sits, balancing all that is good and bad with its power. This force desired a form of control on the omniverse. It had decided to create “Hope”.

This figure stood on top of Zanl looking down at beautiful megaverses and nebulas below. It grew tired of constantly watching his own creation. He had balanced out the entire omniverse multiple times, but doing it was hard work. So he stood up for once and thought of a new creation to add along with the omniverse. He wanted to make an entity. An entity that could automatically prevent destruction and overruling within the omniverse. The figure thought long about his new creation. After thinking, It used both of its hands of positive and negative to create the entity. A blinding light covered the area, and an entity appeared curled up like a ball in the palm of the figure. The figure is proud of itself and drops the entity into the omniverse. He creates a white shell around the entity to protect it. It floats deep in the omniverse. It will eventually wake from its shell and start carrying out its task.

## Origin: 
Comes from the emotion he is based off, which is “Hope”
