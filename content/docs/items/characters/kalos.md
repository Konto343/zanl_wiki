A giant flying eye casted away into a separate dimension. Watches all evil and tries to turn it. Was a blue soul that visited earth at its earliest times.

This “thing” is something with power completely unimaginable by anyone, and shall always exceed all powers in complete existence. Kalos has nobody but yet is a big eye “that sees all ''. It stays in its domain, acting as a place to watch from. This domain can be literally anywhere, and only can be accessed by a portal made from Kalos. To get there, you must be accepted into its domain, or ask permission. To do so, say Kalos’s name 3 times, state your request or reason for entry, be judged and be teleported into its domain. Kalos is rather calm and mannered with people. His reasoning is unmatched, and he’ll give you a lesson if needed. Kalos’s purpose is to oversee and protect the multiverse from anyone willing to change or rule it. Kalos must keep multiverse the way it has always been since it has been born. His is completely omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, and omnibenevolent. Its sight, strength, and knowledge will be able to handle any foe it deems a threat to multiverse. He neither represents good nor evil, but brings judgment.

The eye has a pupil that is 122 ft in diameter and the eye itself is 734.44 ft. in diameter. The eye is a physical form substitute for its formless body. The color of his eye is blue.

Kalos completely knows of Bex’s existence. Bex rarely chats with Kalos as it sometimes seems “interesticng”. Bex does fear Kalos a bit more than anything else. He fears Kalos because it is one of the things that can truly kill him. As long as he doesn't destroy lots of multiverses with bad intentions, then he is fine and won’t be killed.

## Story:
Kalos was born with Bex’s multiverse. The spark of millions of multiverse and universes created countless matter and life. One instance of this life was Kalos. He existed as a combined consciousness of all the lift that existed. Kalos’s formless body, a blue ball of energy, floated across space looking for life. He eventually found it on a distant planet far within the cosmos. He greeted this life and it greeted back. The species managed to communicate with Kalos and perceived him like a god. They learned of each other and created bonds. Kalos understood more of the things around him and learned of his powers. These powers were given to him from the explosion of the multiverse. The energy must’ve flowed into his soul, thus granting him knowledge and power. He looked far for more life across the whole multiverse. Kalos was given a name by a wise old lady who lived in a fishing village on a distant planet. This lady had given Kalos the ultimate wisdom for helping others and seeking justice. Kalos felt a strong bond with the lady and became the thing he is today. One day, while talking to the lady, his soul took form. The bond was so great, he gave Kalos’s soul a form. This form was a blue figure with beautiful white eyes. A couple of days later, he grew long white hair. They sat by each other, learning and understanding more of the world. But the lady grew too old and passed away. Kalos understood and learned that not everything lasts forever. He exited the house and leaped into space. He flew past universes and galaxies with high speed. Furthermore, he stopped himself in the middle of space and turned to face the vast stars. He sought to serve for justice and bestowed judgment to those who committed bad. He sought to watch over everything. Kalos curls into a ball and a large light emits. A huge eye comes from the light. This eye allows for himself to see everything, but it confines his true soul. His eyes would see beyond the stars and look at the truth. He creates a domain that sits beyond reality. This domain would act as his watching tower to seek justice among the innocent.

## Origin: 
I worked on his name for a couple of hours. Creating “Kalo” and “Klaos” and ended up on “Kalos” in the end. This can based off “Kool Aid” I guess.
