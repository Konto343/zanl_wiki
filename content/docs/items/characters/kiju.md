*Created: I Forgot*

Kiju invented the Blood Arts after tampering with stolen cursed ancient texts. He at first wanted to solve a mysterious force that killed innocent citizens -because others did nothing about it. After making the Arts, he used his wealth and position to afford a dojo to teach said Arts.
