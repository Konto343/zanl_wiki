A being with a more uncertain mind 
passion for the world's destruction. However, he seeks to know his purpose.

Created from the Figure, he is the complete opposite of Aeta. And in a not so kind way. He, or rather this creature, is a black figure with razor sharp needles wrapping the entire back of his body and one side of his arms. The weapon he wields is literally himself. His power rivals that of Aeta’s. He is the manifestation of “absolute dread”. Born to ruin souls and life. With his crazed mind, he would unleash unparalleled collapse.

He has two long horns that stretch from the head. Necrodon gets his name from encasing others, and all with extreme pain and death. He only seeks death and pain. To break the minds of those living, and curse those dead. He is born from all hate and anger, He has spikes covering his body. Each spike represents one of the greatest sins that has ever been committed. His skin reflects the deepest hell in the void. His eyes show the 4 strongest sins _you’ve_ committed. Stare for too long, you will go insane. But despite his crazed mind, he can act and speak in a gentle way. But when you anger him too well, he will kill you. If you somehow approach him without dying and manage to get into speaking range, consider yourself lucky. But otherwise you would've been killed. Are you _done?_ No, because there's a bit more to tell. But when Necrodon isn’t writing in his book, he’ll sit down with his head looking at the floor. When he’s not doing that either, he stares into a very specific direction, that being the “front” of the prison. Whatever lies in that direction, he wants or desires. But that’s only Aeta can think of so far.

## Awakening:
Who am I? Who are you? Why do I exist? What is my purpose?

My purpose? I exist for a reason other than being divine. Maybe something of my choice? Maybe a force that allows anything to come under control. I desire such. This “control” would allow anything to be given a task by me and carried out. If I had control, what would I use it for? I’d use it for the purpose of figuring out why I exist. But this thing I stand on lies above a “sea”. This sea reflects upon “stars”. This figure of mine I see. It’s black? A color of that of the void behind the stars. This void gives me sadness. But for what reason? I guess it doesn’t matter. I stare above. So, I look behind the stars to find “Earth”, an object full of life. A life that has gone over many wars and disasters to progress. Murder. Greed. War. A few driving concepts of such an object. Object. A “planet” is what humans call it. Some others call it a “Home”. But despite all the joyful emotion they pass around, all that darkness swirls in secret. So if I could control those and bend them to be happy, all would be good. While I think, a white figure approaches. It says “Brother. Looks like you’ve woken. My name is Aeta.” I reply, “Aeta? It appears I am your brother as well. But I find myself confused.” Aeta questions, “Confused about what, my brother?” I turn to the stars. “About why I was born. I’ve found no reason to truly exist. I have no purpose.” I turn back and look at my brother. Aeta says “Oh I know brother. We exist to protect those in the cosmos. If we are to protect those, you should have a name for yourself. I reply with, “My name. A name. But I seek to destroy those. I want control. So I'll name myself, Necrodon. A name meaning death and power.” Aeta says to me, “You seek to destroy, and I seek to save. If we attempt to erase each other, we both die. Our existence creates balance. Creating and ruining those created. So we shall not fight.” I reply with, “Yes. We create equilibrium. So we will continue to do our duties to forge evolution.” Aeta looks at me and says, “But you should fashion yourself with something.” I look at him, “Fashion myself? Like what those humans have?” Aeta replies with, “Yes. Some kind of objects to attach to your appearance. I shall grant myself a crown representing devotion.” Then my brother summons a white crown above his head. The crown floats onto his head. It contains shards of white that go in a circle. “Interesting choice brother. I shall manifest something as well to go along with my interests. Shall I change myself to see into the 4 sins of man? Two long sharp horns as well on my head to show fear.” I say. “Dear brother, should I say that you are quite scary” Aeta says. “Now I shall commence my duty and watch from afar.” I say. I float to the stars and start my evil.

I’m given a book from my brother one day. Furthermore, I look at its empty pages, thinking to put it on. I embed my 4 eyes into the book's cover. I give it a design I find to my desire. The first page I write with my finger in a language never known to man. This book will contain my intentions, emotions and pictures. “Thank you, Aeta,” I say. I use this book today to find those who seek good and write about everything I learn here. It will have all my foes and their descriptions, powers, faces, and weaknesses.

## Origin: 
I search a prefix for death, I got “Necro”. Searched up a suffix for “power” and “strength”. I Search for a while until I found one, “Don.” Combined the two and got “Necodron” and “Necodon”. I made many different versions and just decided to just add both words together without any modifications. And that left “Necrodon”.

## Recovered Origin:
He comes from a nightmare I had 3 years in November, I think. Around 2020 I had a “nightmare” where I saw a black spiked figure standing afar with light shining on him, and it was smiling extremely. And that’s it. The face comes from a design made. It was like a Daily Draw, where you doodled something every day. That only went on for 2 weeks before I got bored.
