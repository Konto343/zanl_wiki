A god like being who has a female appearance. She has skin void of color and hair blacker than the great voids. She is full of evil and corruption meant to balance the omniverse.

A being who was born of the darkest pits of universe, filled of all the haterd in the cosmos. It killed a unimagainable amount of people in the omniverse. Now that it has been weakened by other being, it has to pass down its power to a person. This person has been predicted by it to be "the one to end all."

## Origin: 
Comes from a word I made, “Nuno” and "Lilith", from Jewish Folklore. So I took “Nuno” and the “lith” part of Lilith’s name and made “Nunolith”. “Nuno” was supposed to be modified version of the word “Nano”, as featured in advanced technology. “Nanolith” was going to be her name, but I decided on “Nunolith”
