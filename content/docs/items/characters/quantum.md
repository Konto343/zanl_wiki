A super intellegent AI created by Bex that is used to help along his life and work.

Quantum or a Quick Universal Autonomous Neural Thinking Unity Machine, is a super artificial intelligence program. Quantum helps with multiple things such as strategy, threat control, calculations, and information. This program is able to do practically anything. It has a core that accts as its main server with an entirely separate smaller GEDD to power it. 

## Story:
Quantum was created from the days after Bex’s contract had ended. When he finished his house, he thought to use his technological skills that he still had. The program was made with skills he had with AGI days. He designed and trained it to be a powerful butler that could assist those. It is a program that has true consciousness. It had taken weeks of constant working, but it proved successful. In the end, Quantum talked for the first time. Bex, without sleep, had his head fall onto the desk he was working on at the time. His head hits the keys of the laptop. The screen of the laptop displays “Final stage: Completed.” All of the other lights lit green showing that Bex had finally made a truly conscious AI. He interpreted Quantum into the house and it grew more and more learning about the world around it. It offered a lot of advice and shaped Bex into a less lazy person. His motivation had boosted and he grew more proud of his creation everyday.

## Origin: 
Based on the AI featured in TAU (movie), and given a name "Quantum", because it sounded cool. Its name now serves the meaning of the technology that it runs of off, which is Quantum Computing.
