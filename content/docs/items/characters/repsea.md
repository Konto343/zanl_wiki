A little girl whose father harmed her mother so much, that she had killed him. Leaves through a horrific life, seeing the "truth" of the world. Her minds breaks as she reaches complete insanity.

Repsea. The manifestation of absolute horror. She might appear as a cute little girl, but the face that hides behind is terrorizing. A face of blood and wide smiles. Showing no remorse for her victims. She would torture them in broad daylight for nights to come. Setting them on fire and cutting parts of their bodies off. Tearing off their skin or pulling their eyes, she had not sought death, but what led to it, which was pain. “The respiration of sweet red blood. It makes me happy!” she had said, sitting among thousands of bloody bodies. Stacked upon that mountain of terror, stood her, something not meant to exist. No matter what it was, rather it is a man, woman, child, or animal, it would never see light again in her presence. The sky turned red, and it rained the red liquid across the lands. The angels were stained by her works, and left in trauma for the rest of life. The ones who know of her stories found themselves dead by shock. She had been so terrifying, that the gates of hell denied her passage, and left her to live.

## Story:
At a very young age, Repsea's parents were going through divorce. Her mother and father never really got along soon after her birth. The constant fights led to downfall. So they decided to break up to prevent any further conflict. The mother decided to take her child with her. Repsea had gotten into school, but she couldn’t find reason to pay attention. But her friends found her cute and friendly. The teachers tried to make her focus, but to no avail. She failed all her tests and assignments. Though her mother knew of this, she thought her child still had a chance to bloom. After a year or so, she had failed the grade. Her mother was disappointed, and she cried, thinking there was no hope. Repsea saw her mother in sadness and approached her. The mother pushed her child away and told her, “go to your room!” The saddened child went into her room and laid on the bed. She looked at the ceiling and thought of how she could have done everything better. She had tried in school after a while. Furthermore, she finally studied and worked hard, but she still failed. She sleeps through the cold night. Goes to school and comes back to her house. She opens the door, and she stares upon it in extreme shock. Blood drips from the couch, and tears run from Repsea’s eyes. And with the first sight of blood, her mother had been killed. Repsea tries to convince herself that her mother wasn’t actually dead. While her sadness ran, a man appeared from the darkness. The man holds a knife. This man had been the one her mother was having an affair with. This man had only loved the mother for her body. Nothing else came into his mind when thinking about her. A false love. The man leaps to the child with his knife. “I couldn’t die now.” Repsea thought. She grabbed the knife left in her mother’s body and quickly turned around. She stabs the man right in the heart. He curses before he dies and falls onto the ground. With her mother dead, she had managed to finish school. But after that she found herself without meaning or purpose. She had gone insane from the sadness and pain. With her crazed mind, she had killed 10 people in secret. From school, her intelligence was beyond the average person. This made her extremely dangerous. The bodies were reported and families left in despair. Detectives failed to find any other clue but the hair she had left at the scene. With every murder, she grew smarter and calmer. The sight of blood seems normal to her. The parts and organs being splattered from a person's body actually made her happy. After 4 years, the people gave her a nickname, the “crimson angel”. An angel which bestowed death rather than blessing. By this point, she had killed and tortured over 50,000 people. The number is insane for just a little girl. No one knew what she looked like, but one person said, “I saw a little child! You must believe me!”. She had stolen everything from them and used it to survive. She had bought herself a beauty dress and many other accessories. Her wealth was that of a royal. She had made friends and killed them. She had only left one friend alive. It was her best friend, “Jessica”. They had met her from a high ranking family within the kingdom. They became great friends and exchanged their wealth at times. Their trust built up and sought only one goal, “burn the world”. They wanted this because the world had treated them badly and they lost their loved ones. The despair turned into anger and hatred. And turned their minds to destroying everything that caused that despair. Jessica knew nothing of Repsea’s murders or intentions, but only saw her as a good friend. After a year, Repsea comes to meet her friend at the mansion. She opens the door to see a knife come out. Repsea dodge quickly and looks at who is attacking her. It was Jessica. Jessica had figured out the truth and saw her as an enemy. The huge amount of killing was useless, it achieved nothing. Jessica remained angered at the fact Repsea had killed one of her family members, who died months prior. She wouldn't forgive, so she attempted to kill Repsea. She swings her knife around to kill Repsea. Furthermore, she cries thinking she had trusted Repsea, but turns out not. Repsea tries to convince it was all false information. Jessica tells her that the evidence that detectives found was connected all to her. It was all “confirmed” and that it had been released to the public. Repsea now has no choice, she leaps into the air behind Jessica. And wraps her arms around her, and chokes her to reconsider. Jessica fails to comply and refuses to join her. They struggle around while Jessica tries to escape from Repsea’s grasp. With her last struggle, Jessica starts to stop breathing. “Jessica! Don’t let me do this!” Repsea said. “Never!” Jessica she manages to say. With her last breath, Jessica’s body fell to floor, never to move again. Repsea looks at her hands, thinking what she has done. Her intent to kill anything along with her hatred had killed her only friend.

She departed and left the country, moving across the vast stormy ocean. She sailed for weeks until arriving at beach. Repsea was hungry for food. Completely desperate, she look around the forest for hours. She gathered berries and killed many animals. A fireplace is made to cook the food. As the deer meats cooks over the hot fire, Repsea looks towards the stars. “What shall I do now without you.” She thought. Her emotions were mixed with anger and sadness. She could remain disappointed at the refusal of joining. She decides to stop thinking about it and falls asleep on the ground. A warm sunrise greets Repsea’s eyes. She stands up and heads in a certain direction, west. The terrain was rough and getting around wasn’t easy. Walking for days to complete one goal, “become a god and kill everything and everyone”. She had to stop once in a while to eat, but once she got there, she wouldn’t be able anything anymore. At her destination, a dark temple stood waiting for her. She enters the ancient place, passing through huge concrete doors. 32 cloaked man approach in a circle formation around Repsea. “Are you her?” one says. She utters a forbidden word to them. “You are the chosen one.” all of them say.

Months prior to her mass murdering sprees, Repsea had discovered the existence of a certain temple. She came across the information through torturing one of her victims. With her person she began to ruin, she demand some kind of secret on power. One of men suddenly said before having their eyes removes, “Wait! Please! I have something that might give some kind of power!” the man says. “Might? Go ahead you scum.” Repsea replies as she softly drags a knife across his throat. The man answers in fear, “There’s a template that lies west of here! Its placed between the Gato and Johod nations!” The knife now drags against his cheeks, “Go on.” she says. “Rumors say that place is home to a great god of ruin! It also says it can grant any person the power of that god!” he says. Repsea points her knife towards the man’s eye, “So why hasn’t anyone already taken the power?” The man replies quickly, “That’s because no knows the phrase to be granted that power. If a correct phase is said to the cloaked who appear, they would commence a ritual to bestow the power. However, if the wrong is spoken, those who come will be discarded from this world!” Repsea cuts the mans forehead slowly. The man whimpers. “So do you know this phrase.” Repsea says. “No one knows it. But there’s a book located in a hidden library beneath the kingdom. I know this because I constructed that library with my peers. We were hired in secret and the pay was pretty high so we couldn’t refuse. But the book you seek is located in a room in that library. That very book holds secret and unknown methods to power. Only a selected few can understand its text in the place. The phrase must be in the purple book since it closely relates to the temple. They were going to burn the book, but someone decided to keep it.” Repsea stabs the knife into a table as she looks at the man. “If what you say is indeed true, I let you go. That is if you cannot speak of my doings.” The man looks in hope, “Yes everything as you wish!” Repsea stands in front of the man in the chair. “You know what, I’m willing to let you go since you were so truthful with me.” She says as the belts trapping the man are released. The man want to escape, “Thank so much! I will keep your secret hidden from this world. He exits the room in relief. He looks through the window of the door to look back at Repsea, but she isn’t there. The knife on the table has also disappeared. The man appears confused, “She must’ve left? I need to get out of here before she finds me again” he thought. He runs down many hallways and arrives at the exit somehow. The beautiful landscape brims with light. He can feel the air breezing out. The man can almost feel freedom and good life. As he exits the building, a knife appears in front of him and stabs into his right eye. Repsea can see just barely above the man. She had sitting outside on top of the exit waiting for him. “On the other hand, there was only thing that you weren’t being truthful with me about.” The knife is taken out along with his eye. “It was being a fool” She says as the man soon experiences death almost instantaneously. The door to the building slams shut as his body is dragged inside. He would never see light again.

She sought the power of the god they spoke of. She began her journey across the land to other side of the world. There she found a massive city with a large castle at its center. She wondered into the castle killing the guards in secret to finally reach a hidden stairwell. She wondered down with touch to meet an iron door. She tried to push the heavy door, but I no use. She goes back to see the castle scrambling to figure who killed the guards. She wonders into a room full of materials and gear. At the top shelf was a red explosive. She grabs it after using a ladder and proceeds to back to the stairwell. She looks down to see many guards there. Luckily, they don’t see the stair well. She needed a distraction. Someone alerted that someone had enter the storage room and the guards rush down. With the chance she had, she leaps off the floor to enter the stairwell. She greets the iron with a smile. Now with an explosive she places it next to the door. She lights the fuse and runs up the stairs to take cover. A loud explosive can heard. Repsea checks the door to see all destroyed. She passes through the door and enter a dark room. “The hidden library. What a sight” She says. The library automatically lights up like if it was welcoming her. She passes through many book shelves and finds a door. The door opens with a loud creak. It appeared to be huge dome of nothingness. An object floats in a beam of light in the middle of the huge room. Repsea gets closer and looks at the object, A thick purple dark book. She grabs the book from the beam and opens it. Turning the cover reveals an unknown language and text. The drawings next to the text provide no help at all. She goes through the entire book trying to understand it. Hours past and nothing can learned of. That is until she reaches the middle of the book, a word. A word in large bold letters. “Nunolith” it read. This word was her best shot to getting the power she wanted. She heads back across the world to her house. For weeks, she stood at her desk trying to decipher the texts. To no avail, she couldn’t do it. She had learned many methods to attempting to crack the text. Going through thousands of books similar to the one she had proved nothing as well. Until one day, she had accepted that nothing worked. Repsea had only that word. So she sailed forth looking for the temple in the west.

Back to the Temple, a cloaked man comes up to Repsea. “Come with us.” He says. Repsea follows the man while the other follow as well. They arrive into a dark room lit by only bright fire. At the middle of the room lied a circular platform. “Step onto here.” He says. Repsea gets onto the platform. “Give your hand.” He says as he is given a knife by another man. “Oh well” Repsea saying while putting her hand forth. The knife cuts through her hand forming an “X”. She is guided over to an object on a stand. It was the purple book she had stolen to obtain the phrase for the ritual. The men must’ve grabbed it when she came in with it. With no questions, Repsea drips the blood over the book. It glows a dark purple. “Will shall take on own lives to summon thee. Do not leave the platform.” He says seriously. The men reform into a circular formation and start chanting. They wave their hands and bow down. After a moment, they stand up to pull out knifes. With one last word from them, “Nunolith”, the man cut their own throats. All of them fall to the ground, forever motionless. Their blood flows from their bodies through cracks in the ground. They eventually reach Repsea standing on the platform. All becomes dark before an intense way pain hits her. All the cells In her body felt like they were being pricked by iron needles. This goes on for 5 minutes before it ends. She falls onto the ground remaining in heavy pain. The lights flicker back with dark purple color. She slowly stand up from her spot and hears a voice, “Come to me.”, it whispers. Repsea looks at the book where those voice had coming from. The voices get deeper and more louder as she approaches. The thoughts of murder and genocide fill her head. She turns the book to see the text. As of this moment, she could finally understand the text. It all made sense. The guide to fully using all of her power. She sits there reading the book with absolute interest. Nothing would be able to phase her while she read. She thinks about the outside world and its forests. Suddenly she opens her eyes to be in that very forest herself. She wavers her hands in certain way according to the book, and the trees in front of her crush with immense force. Repsea looks at her hand and creates black fire. She throws it at a tree to see it instantly burst into flames. The tree decays at alarming rate to leave nothing behind. After trying to sleep, she realized her body wouldn’t need to eat or sleep anymore. “This outfit doesn’t look well on me. Maybe so fixing well do.” Repsea says magically change her outfit to be more “stylish”. A dark purple dress is on her. “’Its overly outfitting for my like liking.” Her body ages rapidly to that of a 36 year old. “That’s better. I could lure people much more easily now.” She speaks. A section in the book describe an army of undefeated soldiers. As it instructs, she places her hand onto the ground and creates a shadowy figure. A dark knight shrouded into a dark smoke with its heavy armor. This 9 foot soldier could slay any enemy she desired. It’s dark purple eyes would stare into someone’s soul and kill them with fear. With every hour, she learned something new. The book had covered almost everything she need to know about her powers. The sun sets, ending the day. With millions of troops, she evaded all the cities in the world all at once. Humanity tried to counter act this dangerous force, but they were simply too strong to defeat. All villages, cities, kingdoms, and houses were raided and people were enslaved to constructed Repsea’s home.

A castle larger than any possible. Constructed out of the hardest stones known to man. A dark fortress that none would dare to oppose. It sat in the midst of all the destruction she had caused. As she stood from her throne, she reads the very last page of the book. The text describes a “him”, saying “that he will rise”. The confused Repsea as the couldn’t possible know who it was. It also said “That he shall defeat the one to rule all”. She looks deeper into the book, it states a fight between the two will ruin the cosmos. “Then only one victor stood, a-” The page had ended there since a tiny piece of it was torn off. She restores the lost piece and its says, “a third being. A person whose gone to evolve past conflict and bring judgment. Will this being finally solve the problems we are soon to have? I only hope that you’re reading this, will you have the hope to survive this event. Shall its name being unknown forever.” Repsea laughs at that information. “A third being? To defeat me!” She says laughing harder. “No will be able to defeat if they had the chance. I shall make position clear to all in this infinite world.”

She stood up from her chair to proceed with she had said. Forever to torment those who came by her path.

## Origin: 
I actually forgot how she was made. I believe I used a “shorter” version of the word “Reaper” which was “Rep”, a word I made up. “Repza”, “Repa”, “Repas” were some versions, but decided on “Repsea”. I just found out something right now (11/10/23), is that once I put the word back words it comes “Aesper”, which is similar to “Vesper.” It could be one way I did it back then.
