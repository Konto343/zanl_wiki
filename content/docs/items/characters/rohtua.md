Rohtua is a permanent cosmic entity that observes the universe at scale. Despite being a genderless entity, Rohtua's personality and chosen physical appearance is male in nature. Conversation with Rohtua will prove he's a kind and mindful person, he will offer assistance into anything one can think of.

He is dressed in full white clothing with a white cape. Rohtua also has long white hair the glows faintly. Two halos float above his head at all times. 

Accompanying Rohtua, two large dark pillars float beside him. These pillars are to be the supposed "lost" pillars of emotion, Nada and Strah (Hope and Fear). Rohtua has complete physical control of these objects, being able to manipulate them physically at great speed. These pillars will always be next to him, even if they're not visibly seen. 

Rohtua was created from Eternity as it's first creations, effectively making Rohtua one of the first "pure souls" along Nunolith.

Rohtua's powers are simply those that can freely manipulate the universe at his thought. The scale of his powers are unmeasurable, but no higher than Eternity's.

Rohtua is Nunolith's husband, however, is constantly distanced from her to prevent equilibrium distortion.
