# Lassolom
*Created: (March 1, 2023)*

Lassolom is the hyperspace that contains all the omniverses in existence. The space that sits in between omniverses is the super non-existent void called the “absolute void”. This space has many other names. These names are given to this hyperspace by people who know of its existence. Some other name that’s given to this space would be the “Avangard”.  If you are wondering what sits outside this layer, don't ask, there's only the “Nothingness”.
