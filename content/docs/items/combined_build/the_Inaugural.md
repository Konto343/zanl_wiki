# The Inaugural 
*Created: (March 1, 2023)*

The Inaugural is the birth of Lassolom. Lassolom started as a black and white mass. This mass collapsed into an unbelievably dense singularity. The singularity exploded into a beautiful sight of omniverses. Then Lassolom experienced light for the first time. This gave birth to the omniverse we know as “Zanl”.
