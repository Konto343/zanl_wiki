# The First Existence
*Created: (March 1, 2023)*

A event that describes the first things to ever “exist”. But no one knows what existed when things started existing. So we only guessed for now what had happened. Elders are suspected of being part of the First Existence. Elders are the oldest things to ever exist.  Elders control all of existence behind or beyond the omniverse. They can control existence without existing themselves. No soul. No form. Elders will only do something if it threatens their “existence” or the omniverse. They sit around the omniverse in a group of 5.

Their names are:
- Sin
- Stra
- Sikh
- Son
- Sret

They all started with “s”. Zero-creativity i know. They could’ve used other cool letters like “a” and “z”. But enough of “they”, Elders are tall, really tall. About 4 times the sun’s height relative to the omniverse. But since they exist outside the omniverse. It technically means they are the largest things to exist. The Omniverse is about 2 suns in length, despite it being an infinite hyperspace of multiple universes and multiverses. To get to them, it's impossible in all ways to do so. Because no thing can “exist” but the Elders outside the omniverse. Bex tried to exit the Omniverse, but failed. This is because he isn’t simply able to exist outside of it. Nor do the Elders allow anything to exist outside of the omniverse besides them.  You might be asking how do I know all of this? I don’t. I can only guess at what’s really outside the omniverse. It’s up to creativity. Making this all up is easier on the brain since there's less confusion and questions.
