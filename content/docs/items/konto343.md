# Konto343
*Created: (July 9, 2021)*

My username.

## Origin/Notes: 
I saw my number, 343, today when watching a scp video with "scp-343". I saw it yesterday when checking the time randomly. At this point I see the number too many times. Not just on the internet, but in real life. I see it in gas prices, tickets, dates, labels, or in math equations. There's even an entire company with the number. I mean "343 Industries", the creator of Halo. That is impossible since there was a one in infinite or 1000 chance of some company having the number. 

The reason it's my favorite number is because it brings me good luck and I see it everywhere. 

It all started with me creating a Burner Email. "konto" comes from the words "Burner" in Polish. Why Polish? A random language was picked to make the wording special and unique other than a bland email like "BurnerAccount637@gmail.com".

I remember it prompted me for an username when I made the Google account. So I looked at the time and it was 3:43 PM. And then I thought, Konto + 3:43. Then Konto343 was made. AND BOOM. I checked the time because Konto alone was not enough so I needed numbers. Also makes it unique I guess. But this was supposed to be a temporary email that I could use and then later on delete.

## Recovered Origin:
“Konto343” was the username of the Spotify account i made at the time.

"Konto" being from the first half "Burner Account" in Polish.
"343" being 3:43 PM, which was the time i used during the account's creation.
