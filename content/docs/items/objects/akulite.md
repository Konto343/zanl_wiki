# Akulite
*Created: (January 14, 2024)*

A rare white diamond forged under the extreme tension of rocks. Its magnetic properties come the immense compress it undergoes, allowing it attract objects of almost any kind. It attracts more specifically metals and other crystals of itself. Has a soft internal shimmer with beautiful reflection. Is mostly confused with diamonds, and hard to find due to its small size. Found on Godden.
