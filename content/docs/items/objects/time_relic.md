# Time Relic
*Created: (May 22, 2021)*

A necklance that can control time in area (soon to control ALL time). Was owned by Jinoth and then passed to Bex.

The Time Relic is a necklace which holds a very special emblem. If you stare deep enough into this emblem, it be concluded that it seems to infinitely repeating fractal that gets smaller and smaller. The necklace is made from pure iron which makes it quite durable against extreme forces. This necklace can grant it user, to whoever is wearing it, the power to control time within that universe. Allowing the reversal, skipping, forwarding, and stopping of time.

## Story:
A long time ago in a random part of a unknown megaverse, suddenly multiple universes collapse into each other. A black hole forms devouring everything in its path, but it gets smaller and smaller. The black hole itself implodes leaving green mist behind. There it stood floating through space, a giant green rock which surface reflected everything in the cosmos with glimmer. For a brief moment it stood completely still before blinding everything with a bright flash. It disappeared…

No, something remained, a small stone. This stone was extremely unstable and moved across space chaotically. It entered and left universe faster than light. Anything that touched the stone vaporized instantly. Moving at its highest it set course to particularly certain planet, earth. There it vaporized the ground and created huge crators, killing all kinds of wildlife. The more it destroyed the slower it got. Despite moving extremely fast the stone came in contact with a stone mountain. There it laid finally still at least, the time relic. It sat on this pre historic planet for millions of years.

## Origin: 
Comes from what the necklace does, which controls “time”. The “Relic” part was added since the Time Relic was found by Bex in a temple located secretly in a jungle. It simply described how old the item was, so adding “Relic” made it sound cooler, but it had purpose.
