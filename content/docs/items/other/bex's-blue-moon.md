# Bex's Blue moon 
*Created: (~February ?, 2023)*

This is a project created by Bex for when he is “Too lazy” to kill a class-3 or lower (refer to Bex’s thinking) threat or protect earth. This will only launch the necessary amount of weapons to kill the target, instead of launching a whole damn army or something (depending on the threat class).

There is a button on the Modoko control board labeled “Project  ”. He has the same exact button in his room at his house. “Project Blue moon” is a project for defeating or killing threats and monsters on/or near earth. The weapon grid exists inside throughout of the Black moon.

Once called, it will activate a super weapon grid consisting of:
- 25900 Fighter jets
- 15720 Gun drones
- 5560 Portable laser turrets
- 2400 Geon cannons
- 130 Portable laser rail guns
- 10 super dreadnoughts
- Takam
- 90000 Neutrino warheads
- 56000 Atom bombs
- 25000 Jaks (Explosion of smaller powerful bombs)
- 70000 Erasers (Matter erasers)
- 20000 Pencils (Thin, fast and tsar-bomba like)
- 300 Oxy (Black hole bombs)
- 5 H.O.P.E (Hell Of Permanent Enragement, Universe destroying)

Once the target is killed, all weapons will return to their “Slots” (warehouses) inside the Black Moon.
