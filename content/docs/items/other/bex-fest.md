# Bex fest
*Created: (~February ?, 2023)*

This is an event where all versions of Bex from different timelines come to. This takes place on a “heaven like” structured land with many sub-events like concerts, driving, markets, etc. No fighting that causes disruption in the event or to others, and will not be permitted. The “heaven” is placed inside a huge and beautiful galaxy in ring 3 of Zanl. The Stars of Adam are viewable here. The event only lasts one day. But since there is an infinite amount of Bex walking around and talking, the omniverse has a chance to slightly become unstable for a couple of seconds.

(Happens every 1000 years.)
