# Bex-ception
*Created: (~February ?, 2023)*

To explain how this works, we must understand “The Basic Rules of Universes”, or TBRU. The TBRU states that any existing entity shall exist infinitely in infinite timelines in an infinite amount of universes. Also goes for an infinite amount of multiverses and so on. That means once something has started to exist, it can’t “un-exist”. So if we apply this to Bex (should it always), he simply can’t die even if chose to or was killed. There’s an exception to this TBRU statement, though. In the same chapter in the next paragraph, it states “If said entity has its honest core or “soul” broken, shall it no longer exist.”. That means, to “kill” Bex, you must destroy his true soul.

Went off the rails there. So Bex-ception is like, “Oh no! My evil clone!”, where you scream in fear and half a second later, your clone kills you, and you die in a dreadful way. Unlucky you. Better luck next time!

TO THE POINT, Bex-ception is “the viewing or observance of another Bex from a different timeline, which is not one’s self.” And for Bex’s sake, somehow at viewing or interaction of another Bex will not result in complete annihilation.

“Bex-ception” is just a concept other Bexes have made. It gets confusing, so I'll ignore this for now.
