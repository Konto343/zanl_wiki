# Calyale Cateba Deceus Gremune Jinoth Korox Lakres Okasni

## Notes: 
I created these name from a long list of demons and devils. I would get first half of one demon and the ending half of another. I combined the two and made a lot of names, which only counted to around 17. I made character docs with each name I believed would fit into the Zanl story line. I excluded the rest since I had basically been making characters with zero lore and background. I did this as a desperate attempt to fill up the “Private” section of Zanl. But, I’ve been working them more and more and giving them importance. 

As of right now (6/10/23), Gremune, Jinoth, Korox, and Okansi still have no background or even words in their documents.
