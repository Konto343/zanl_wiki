# Omniverse 
*Created: I Forgot*

Zanl is the name of the project that contains all my ideas. But it is also the name of the Omniverse that all my concepts reside in.

If you're wondering of how the structure of an Omniverse
 works in my mind, here you go (Big to small):

- Omniverse → Megaverse → Multiverse → Universe

I know it might be a lot deeper, but it will be like this for simple understanding.
Here’s a structure of Zanl for those curious:

- Ring 5:
	- The outermost part of Zanl. Mostly nothing just remains of Zanl when it was born.
- Ring 4:
	- Long strips of Megaverses and faint nebulae
- Ring 3:
	- More condensed area of Megaverses and beautiful mega-nebulae
- Ring 2:
	- Megaverses are almost everywhere and glow brightly
- Ring 1:
	- Megaverses are literally everywhere
- Ring 0:
	- Empty space except for nebulae and Homestead.
- Outside:
	- Empty void and complete darkness. Nothing exists here except one.
