# P-U-W-S
*Created: (4/26/24)*

A automated array of satellites that orbit a planet. Each satellite has multiple info gathering tools through its cameras and sensors. Completely automated through a network computer and its software. The array is able to handle and gather infomation on any spot on a planet and react accordingly through its "tools" (Weapons) to stop or delay events. Any amount of satellites can sit in the array and scale up 2000 before the network computer fails to manage all the satellite nodes.

## Notes: 
P.U.W.S stands for Personal Utilty Weather System. All i can say, was that it was made long (~8 months) before i saw the movie Geostorm.
