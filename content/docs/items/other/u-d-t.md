# Universal Date Time
*Created: (~February ?, 2023)*

This is a system, created by Bex. It works as a clock for all people within the omniverse, though Bex is the only person to use the system. This format dates the time:

- UDT-21-0-10265 [365-24-60-60)

The first word is the format of time, obviously. The first number is the global time alignment, which goes in googolplex. Bex had estimated the omniverse to 21 googolplexes old. He used light to determine the age, with complex math and some other factors. The second's number is the googol year. Every googol of earth years, the number would go up. The third number represents the year alignment, or the number years after the start of the current googol year.

The numbers within the brackets are exact time. Using brackets is an option. The order goes in day, hour, minute, and seconds. All of which are earth’s measurements, so there are 365 days. The hours are working like on  a 24 clock.
