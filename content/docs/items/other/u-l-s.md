# Universal Location System
*Created: (~February ?, 2023)*

This is a system, created by Bex. This system defines the absolute position of an object in space within a universe.. It is described with an object’s position relative to something else based on context. Context being where the location of its user is or something.

A position tag would look like one of the following:

- 234°, 120°, 51° (12.42543643 P)
- Sydney Observatory, 1003 Upper Fort St, Millers Point, Sydney, NSW, Australia, Earth, The Solar System, Orion Arm, The Milky Way, Local Group, Virgo Cluster, Virgo Supercluster
- 192837409237473247

The first tag works in the XYZ format for rotation and uses parsecs (P) or megaparsecs (MP) and. It would describe the direction from a relative object and then the distance in that direction. Time would be the alternate option for using distance, and that would use super eons. The second tag uses an Identification system. It's like an address given to objects/planets in space within the entire universe. A full address is recommended for a complete location. The third tag uses a sector number. A sector is a giant cubical part of space. The universe would be divided into these sectors. Each sector is 5 miles in length, height, and width. The sectors would begin from the “center” of that universe. The center of the universe would be calculated off its cosmic microwave background. This would continue to be the center despite the universe expanding and changing.

I recommend using the first tag in this system since it’s the easiest to understand and use.
