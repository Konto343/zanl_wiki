# Universal Space System
*Created: (~February ?, 2023)*

This is a system, created by Bex. It is used to identify objects in and across the omniverse. This deals with anything similar to a universe. If you want to know where something is, the following would be seen:

- 1082-23-1-2

What do those numbers mean, you might ask? I’ll tell you. The first number to represent which Megaverse that the object is in. The second number is the Multiverse. The third number is Universe. And finally, the fourth number is the timeline of that universe. The full tag would be something like:

- 0-1082-23-1-2-3-1

Here's what each number means: The first one is Omniverses. But since there isn’t a chance that more omniverses exist, the number is always zero. The other numbers are just as the same stated above, but the sixth number means the dimensional plane. The dimensional plane is the hidden spaces that have higher dimensions that exceed that universe’s own. The plane you enter will be unique for that dimensional level. So if you enter the 4D plane of that universe, you won’t be seen by other entities that enter that plane as well. Those planes can act as escape routes for very powerful beings. Finally, the seventh number, this number acts as the “cross-concept version (CCV)”. This number identifies the way that universe is conceptualized within other Megaverses. For example, We are in a universe where there’s a pizza planet. The CCV would be 0, since it's the original version of the concept or object. Now in another Megaverse there's the very same pizza planet, but reality is different, and the planet is blue. The CCV of 1 would lead here. All the numbers go up by discovery order. So for planets, earth would be 0, and the moon would be 1. Since the moon was discovered while learning about earth.
