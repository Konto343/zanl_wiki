"The First Workers"

A organization setup by the Sharà. Though that this group has watched everything for a very long time, they weren't actually the first. They couldn't have been the first, because it was simply impossible due to what they were even managing. The omniverse was born at a point forever unknown, luckily this group has made in "time" to structure themselves to prevent a monolithic disaster.

## Ranks:
- Sokà (Thinkers)
    - Book
    - Halo
- Jurà (Schedulers)
    - Orb
    - Spiked halo
- Sharà (Author)
    - Two pillars
    - A very spiky halo
