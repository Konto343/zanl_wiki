A giant diamond shaped prison that acts as the only and best prison that can be used to hold the most dangerous of criminals.

Site omega. Or its full name, Outerspace Maximum Enforced Guarded Arc is a prison that has 243 layers of defense. The site comes in the shape of a diamond, and each layer is made of a super solid compound. This prison acts as a container for very special people. People who have committed the most terrifying crimes known to man. Some, if stated, would scar people mentally. Thankfully, all of them remain in prison for the rest of their lives. They are not allowed to leave their cells or interact with other prisoners. Everything is strict and severely limited. The cell and food are too small for any kind of enjoyment. All you could do was lay against your bed and stare at the ceiling. The closer you got to the center of the prison, the worse criminals you saw. And at the center stood the worst of the worst, the king of all bad. His name is Dan Garrison. The worst you could think of is what he could’ve done to get there. But he managed to break every single law and rule in the galaxy. He had committed the worst of human behavior. “He is a monster, '' some say. Listing every single thing he did while he was in his prime would take years to explain. He was locked up in the prison at the age of 34 and so far lived 17 years in the facility. He is rarely served food, but yet he manages to stay alive. When the workers peer into his containment room, he can always be seen smiling. “It gets creepy after a while.” one employee says. He physically aged a bit, but that man waits for something. He does nothing but sit in one spot all the time. When the workers all take their break and sleep, slight scratching can be heard inside his cell. One day an officer noticed this and checked on Dan. As he got closer to the cell, the scratching became louder. At the door, Dan can be heard talking quietly. The officer didn’t know what he was saying, but as he looked through the small window, he wouldn’t remain the same. What that officer saw, couldn’t and will not be explained. All the other people knew was that the officer shortly went insane and was put into an asylum. The noise that came from Dan’s cell stopped, and no one would ever solve what caused that event.

The cube-like prison is about 1000 miles long across each edge. Each layer is about 0.243 miles in thickness.

## Story
As the older prison grew rusty, Lakres thought of an idea. Since the prison they had currently was crumbling, a new and better one could be constructed. They had captured many criminals and were running out of space to keep them. It was also hard to mine out of the mountains and icy landscape. So Lakres proposed the idea of a new prison. The higher ups liked the idea from their Grand Leader. So with the recent discovery of better technology, designers and engineers were quick to construct the design of the prison. They took days and nights to finish it. Some didn’t sleep, so they could serve the Grand Leader. Three days pass and construction starts. Millions of workers construct the new and massive prison in space. The huge cube acted as the planet’s moon. It was too large to even be considered a prison anymore. All the prisoners new and old were transported to the cube prison. They all instantly hated it, but only men loved it. This man was the worst one out of all of them, Dan Garrison. Walks past all the other prisoners in the heavy chains and cuffs. Hundreds of men point their guns at Dan as he walks to the center of the base. The huge sphere was going to act as his new home for eternity. He enters his sphere with a smile. The doors shut behind him instantly. The layers of the facility split open in half to allow for transport of items. They can’t add doors to each layer since the layers are considered “unbreakable”. That was a part of the prison’s design, to be “strongest” among all. As Dan’s cell was completely secured, all the layers of the facility closed together. The prison was finally completed and ready for operation.

## Origin
Just comes from the Greek letter omega’s meaning of being “a number higher than infinity” in the mathematics field. The word is used to represent the prison's strength and security.
