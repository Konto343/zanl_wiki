# Sector-C9B (Black-Moon)
*Created: (August 21, 2021)*

A base constructed by Bex that acts as his main place of living whenever he is on Earth.

The C9B Facility is a “house” or a large superstructure. This base serves as a base of operations and regular living. The name of the main base is called the “Black Moon”. This base is made with super advanced technology and weapon systems. The “exterior” of the base includes an unbreakable shield with serious firepower. The “interior” of the base includes huge spaces divided into “sectors”. Each sector serves a different purpose and is in the shape of hexagons. In the middle of these sectors is the hub. The hub includes an extremely large space where a massive GEDD lies. This GEDD is called “The Core” and is what powers the base. In 6 directions in the Hub are large doors of stone. These doors are the entrances into the sectors. For quick movement around the base, a train is located on the outer edge of the hub. This train sits on the ground and moves from one sector to another really quickly.

## Origin: 
Named after an old Roblox game I first made which was military and prision based. It contain floors where the lower you got, the stranger things you saw, like contained monsters. The creatures would appear extremely odd and disfigured. You could say it was like the SCP Foundation in a way, since I used inspiration from that series. “C9B” was just a random combination of letters and numbers
