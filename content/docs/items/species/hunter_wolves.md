# Hunter-Wolves
*Created: (January 15, 2024)*

A kind of wolf that grew upon the coldest land imaginable. They have large coats of white fur and orange eyes. They move in packs of less than 15 and groups up to 4. They can smell prey, however the smelling is very terrible. Using their eyes, Hunter Wolves can only attack prey if it shows signs of movement. They sleep for at most 3 hours before being able to hunt the rest of the day.
