A jet constructed to serve as the ultimate stealth vehicle for war. However was created Bex along with the power at Planet-X1.

Eluribus Z1 is a low-profile stealth jet that can get to other places really quickly. It has 2 high end thrusters. These thrusters allow the ship to hit air max speed of mach 20 or, 15345.383 miles per hour. The ship can move in outer space, but it must have a ultra-cool liquid inside the engine coolant tanks. With that, it can propel into space and reach a max speed of 92 mach or, 76726.915 miles per hour.

This one still uses energy loops to make huge amounts of power for the ship. This engine sits behind the cockpit in between the two thrusters on the sides.

For its defensive abilities, it has a high-density shield that can block all kinds of enemy fire. It can deploy flares to stop incoming missiles from following behind. It carries 17 types of ammunition for firepower. There are 2 mini guns that pop out from the undersides of the cockpit and shoot enemies. It can camouflage in any environment perfectly with its camo panels. It has only 1 seat but can fit 3 people physically in the space it offers.

Likewise, it appears to be a modified B-2 spirit bomber, but its interior and overall build are completely different. The shape of it may be similar, but the locations of important parts of the ships are changed. Its wings are slightly more tilted for increased “air dynamic performance.” On the wings near the cockpit, there will be letters. These letters will be “Z1”, which stands for the seconds part of the ship's name. The ship is mostly black with a slight orange and white design going on.


## Origin: 
Comes from a coin I found on the ground near my mom’s car when I was getting out to get into the house when that day of school was over. That name is simply a misspelling of “E Pluribus Unum”, which was the motto proposed for the first Great Seal of the United States by John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson in 1776. A Latin phrase meaning "One from many".
