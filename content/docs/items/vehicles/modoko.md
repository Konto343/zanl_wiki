A faster than light space ship that can travel across the cosmos in no time. Designed to be the fastest.

The Modoko is a large and fast spaceship created by Bex. This ship was created with the intent being a super space vessel. This ship can travel to any distance using the Eclipsis Drive in 2 minutes. The ship moves at infinite speed to any location specified. The Modoko has the ability to warp beyond universes, multiverses, megaverses. It can travel anywhere within the omniverse. The ship is equipped with Quantum for easy going assistance. It also has many offensive operations and defensive actions against threats. The ship has 13 separate and powerful barriers that deflect incoming attacks.

There are a set of 3 crystals on each side of Modoko near its back. These purple energy crystals were formed by the Bex. The crystals hide inside the Modoko’s sides on the back of the ship. The crystals are made of extremely dense and compressed energy. The crystals also feed energy to the engine. These crystals have a lifetime of only 1 month. Each crystal explodes with a blast yield of 50–58 megatons of TNT. Also, there has to be 6 crystals to wrap at USS, but If there’s only 5 crystals then the ship can only move at DGS 1. Each one can boost the ship 0.2 DGS if one crystal is missing.

The drive on the ship is called the “Eclipsis Drive”, which converts energy into positive and negative spaces that are placed outside the ship. These spaces or fields can move the ship at infinite speed. It starts off slow, then gradually gets faster.

The engine is a type of engine that can create infinite energy with a small amount of energy using loops. It uses a small amount of energy from one of the crystals provided and feeds it into the engine. Which produces twice the energy that was fed in. Then that energy is fed, and the cycle repeats instantly. It takes 4 seconds to reach “infinite” energy, which is then fed into the Drive. The Engine also powers multiple utilities around the ship. Such as basic plumbing, heat, lights, air conditioning. Most of this power goes to the barrier that wraps around the entire ship and the Drive.

The Engine has the ability to warp at infinite speed, but it takes 5 seconds to travel any distance or any point in the universe, plus an extra 4 seconds to actually prepare the warp. “Multiverse traveling” is also a feature (like the norb’s) as long as you have the Time Converter in a “Unstable module” on the “Module panel”, you get to any multiverse unaffected. “Multiverse traveling” does take time to work, it takes 10 seconds to charge the engine completely with energy, and prepare to travel to warp. It takes 20 seconds for “Time conversion” to finish and get to your destination. “Time conversion” is the conversion from something from one multiverse to another different multiverse. The crystals have a lifespan of 5 years, at the end of the crystal's lifetime, the crystal

The barrier or barriers consist of 13 layers that exist on higher dimensions, so simple attacks are completely ineffective. Layer zero is the strongest barrier as it is the closest barrier. The only way to defeat this barrier is that Bex simply turns it off, otherwise nothing can get through the barrier. This barrier involves the ability to change outcomes. Each layer after barrier 4 has a layer of Anti-probability on the outside of it.

Modoko also has a big gyro called “S.N.S” (Space Navigation System). This system can calculate a path to a destination almost instantly without having to worry about colliding into black holes, stars, planets, etc. It can also calculate while the ship is at DGS speed.

## Origin: 
I recovered some old documents and oddly enough, the Modoko was actually "Youyou" before it became Modoko.
