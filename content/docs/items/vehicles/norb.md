A golden sphere that warp at light speed using golden rings that come out of it. Is able to shoot laser and project damage at enemies.

The Norb is a high-speed spaceship. It appears to be a golden sphere with 6 six rings that acts like a spaceship. Each side of the sphere has 3 rings. These rings are embedded into the sphere and can detach. These golden rings can also expand to provide extra functionality. The rings can turn and spin to create light-speed acceleration, shield, or an energy cannon. The Norb is powered by an infinite energy source. This source of energy is a white ball of extremely dense mass. This ball of mass gives power to the rings and the ship’s features. The ship has a control panel for controlling the ship. This panel can enable one of the ship’s abilities, “Multiverse traveling”. Multiversal traveling allows for the quick transportation between multiverses and universes. If a Time Converter is placed inside an “Unstable Module”, you can allow other people to travel with you unaffected. You can move quickly across the megaverse, but if you want to get somewhere really quickly, you need exact coordinates. With the very exact coordinates, the Norb can warp to that location instantly.

To access such a ship, a door will form across the middle of the ship. A staircase will form underneath to get you up to the door. Pass the door, you’ll discover a fancy and comforting space. There was a lot of room to chill out in. There was a kitchen and beds on the sides and a control panel in the front. In the middle was a couch and TV. There are stairs going down to view the energy source and advanced mechanics of the ship.

## Origin: 
Literally just the word “orb” with an “N” at the beginning. Yeah it was that simply naming this creation. I guess it was fine. It was going to “Zorb” but an “N” sounded better.
