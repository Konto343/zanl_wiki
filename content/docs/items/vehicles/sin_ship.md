# Sin Ship (Grekhern)
*Created: (~2022)*

A old ruined ship that flies by in the shadows. If a person thinks of a sinful thought, a metal hook will ram into that person head, and drain their blood. No harm or pain is inflicted to the end user, however, a increase of weight is noticed.

## Origin: 
Grekh ("sin" in Russian) + ern

## Notes: 
This was created a long time ago, somewhere in 2022, however i didn't document the creation date.
