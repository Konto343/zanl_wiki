A sword forged from of the strongest metal in the known universe. Zoi's greatest creation yet.

A sword only obtained by those who are worthy of it. Its name comes from the material it’s made of, which is called “Nontrix”. Nontrix is a material made from a mix of Antimatter, black iron and normal copper. Making of this material is nearly impossible, but yet an unknown forge somehow made the material and molded it into a sword. The sword was kept in a shine, deep below the planet earth. No one knows the people that created the sword, or why they picked earth to conceal it. The things we do know are that it wields great power for those who are worthy of it.

The idle state of Aperen is form zero, or the Hell Coin. The Hell Coin is just a regular quarter, but it is red and the tails side is Heaven Tails and the heads are Hell heads.
  
The length of the sword in Form 1 is about 6 feet and 9 inches. Other dimensions haven't been decided on yet.

## Story:
A sword flies through space at incredible speed. It pierces space and nebulae. This piece of metal hurls through an asteroid field, destroying everything in its path. The sword soon sees the beautiful light of the sun. It passes by two ice giants in the outer solar system. It sees other giant planets, one with rings and size. The moon of that planet can be seen in the distance as the sword flies pass. The sword soon greets Mars and heads directly to earth. The long sword meets the atmosphere of Earth. It catches on fire as it descends with haste. The sword lands deep inside the earth. The impact ruptures the world and the ground shakes. Native humans explore and find the source of such an interruption. The sword lies deep and can be seen at the top of the creator. 

The people find the sword and try to pick it up. They fail to budge it even the slightest, but then the leader of the tribe wields the sword effortlessly. They praise him. The sword leads him and wins him many battles against his enemies. The sword is passed along to many people that it finds worth. One day it is passed to a man who finds the sword dangerous. 

He seeks to lock it away in a mountain forever. He said its power could be used with the wrong intention and lead the world to fall. His men were ordered to construct a temple on a mountain. It was made at the bottom and never knew of its purpose. All of it was made in secrecy. The sword’s past was erased and forgotten by those who knew. The wielder of the sword soon placed the sword in a stone. He sealed the doors off forever. The temple was camouflaged with the environment, so nobody would discover it. The man had thrown some other things into the template that were considered “forbidden”. Those items stood more hidden than the sword they discovered. 

The temple grew with the environment and jungle formed around it. It aged and was left to still be unknown by humans. That is, until one day that one man visited.

## Origin: 
    Originally was named after the first concept material I made, “Aperenium”. I renamed the material and named the sword after its old material instead. I cut “ium” part and created the “Aperen”.

## Notes: 
The Aperen has multiple forms. However it retains its shape inside of small coin that Bex finds. Inspired from parts of the Bible, Bex chose to name both each side. "Hell Heads" and "Heaven Tails."
