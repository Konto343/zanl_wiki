# Heliga-knivar 
*Created: (November 7, 2021)*

Rohtua's swords. Undoubtly, the strongest physical weapon in Zanl. Crafted through decades of hard poured energy and time. Its appearance is a elegant blade which is just as long a human. The blade itself shimmers off the light of stars within itself. The "cross guard" of a sword appears as a 4-pointed star that glows bright white. These pairs of long rods come from the 2 pillars that stay near Rohtua.

## Notes: 
This sword was originally going to be apart of Bex's or the Aperen's final evolution (transcendance). The 'swords' used to be only a single object, which was called went under the old name of "Hyper doven"

The dimensions are roughly:
- Height: 3.3 centimeters
- Width: 4.1 centimeters
- Length: 1.778 meters

## Origin: 
Name comes from "Holy Knives" in Swedish. A small reference to Ikea Furniture's naming scheme.
