Necrodon’s journal

A book given to Necrodon from Aeta. This book is just a simple gift. Nothing special about it, except it having completely empty pages. This book contains the text that reveals the truth behind Necrodon’s intentions. But the text is written by Necrodon, so the language cannot be deciphered. The symbols used are odd enough, and it doesn't make sense of how the text is written. That’s because the text is written in rows and columns. Oh, that was only the first half of the book. The second half of the book is even more obscure and forbidden. This part includes images drawn by Necrodon. 

These images are so horrific and extreme that Aeta wiped his memory of them when he spied on Necrodon. But despite that, those images tell of a truth that cannot be learned of. The text can't even be considered text because there's one symbol or graphic per page with an image. Then the last page contains Necrodon’s face. Aeta doesn’t why he did that, but it shouldn't be too much of a concern. The front cover also has his face. There are some empty pages that Necrodon draws and writes in. The book has 248 pages. Simply, the first half contains “information”, and the second half contains “pictures”. 

Aeta cannot decipher the information despite his power. If the book gets full, old pages disappear until they are recalled upon.
