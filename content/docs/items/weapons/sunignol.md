Aeta’s weapon. Anyway, It can take the form of any other weapon or shape through the Aeta’s mind. This weapon can literally do anything. For example, it could spit into a trillion moon-sized shards that rush towards its target at light speed. It can transform into a black hole, the sun. It can act as a barrier or shield. Turn in a scythe that slices a literal megaverse in half. Turn into a rope that can entangle a target billions of times over. Or divide a person into infinite pieces. It can become a human butler that makes you the finest food in the cosmos. Or become a dog that explodes a planet. Maybe that last one was a bit weird.

However despite all that, this weapon is *too powerful to exist.*
