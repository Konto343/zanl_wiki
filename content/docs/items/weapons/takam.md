A super weapon half the size of the sun that can beam far away objects with a powerful laser powered by a mini-blue dwarf.

A super weapon created in space. This weapon is powered by a really tiny blue-white dwarf star. This weapon is a large GEDD device that has 8 rings that allow the weapon to stabilize. With its 8 rings to harass and control its power, it makes mass-destruction look like an easy job. 

Takam is always completely invisible and stays at a safe distance from earth to prevent collision to other planets and to earth. It's currently used to destroy really big threats and protect earth. When firing, all rings align in “X” formation with their gaps (energy routers) pointing towards their target.

## Origin: 
Came from my brain some how. I was picturing takam’s structure in my head, and suddenly thought “Takam”. I was messing with different words like “Tac” and “Tic”. I simply took inspiration from the little mint candies called “Tic Tacs”. I replace the “c” in “tac”  with “k” and made “Tak” and then added an “am” to the end. “Taka”, “Takac”, or “Tacem” could’ve been the name, but I chose not to use them. “Takam” sounded and looked the best.

## Notes: 
I found using the name of a super little candy to describe a super weapon twice the sun’s size, a little funny.
